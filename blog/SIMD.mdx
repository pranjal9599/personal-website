WebAssembly SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) currently in development and soon will be added.


### What is SIMD

SIMD is an interesting concept of parallel computing and can make huge performance gains in some cases.
What essentially SIMD is instead of performing a single calculation on a single element of an array 
or vector on single instruction it can perform calculations on multiple or all elements
(depending on type and size) in a single SIMD instruction.  


### Areas which will have major performance gains
- Audio Processing
- Video, Image Processing
- Anything involving vector/tensor operations

It is commonly required in image processing to <b>apply the same operation/calculation to all the pixels</b>. Example might
include changing hue of an image where it is needed to go through all the pixels and manipulate their rgb value.

### Without SIMD

### With SIMD

Similarly in machine learning and artificial intelligence <b>vector & tensor product</b> are needed to be calculated and 
SIMD can really fasten it up and improve performance by large factor.

### Using SIMD with emscripten
SIMD can be enabled using `-msimd128` flag when compiling using <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/simd.html">emscripten</a>.

`emcc -O3 -msimd128 in.c -o out.wasm`

#### C function of example in above image: 
```c
void tripleArr(int *arr, int n) {
	for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
		arr[i] *= 3;
	}
}
```
<br />

#### Compiled without SIMD
```
(func $1 (; 1 ;) (param $0 i32) (param $1 i32)
  (local $2 i32)
  (local $3 i32)
  (if
   (i32.gt_s
    (local.get $1)
    (i32.const 0)
   )
   (loop $label$2
    (i32.store
     (local.tee $3
      (i32.add
       (local.get $0)
       (i32.shl
        (local.get $2)
        (i32.const 2)
       )
      )
     )
     (i32.mul
      (i32.load
       (local.get $3)
      )
      (i32.const 3)
     )
    )
    (br_if $label$2
     (i32.ne
      (local.tee $2
       (i32.add
        (local.get $2)
        (i32.const 1)
       )
      )
      (local.get $1)
     )
    )
   )
  )
 )
)
```
<br />

#### Compiled with SIMD
```
   (loop $label$3
      (v128.store align=4
       (local.tee $4
        (i32.add
         (local.get $0)
         (i32.shl
          (local.get $3)
          (i32.const 2)
         )
        )
       )
       (i32x4.mul
        (v128.load align=4
         (local.get $4)
        )
        (i32x4.splat
         (i32.const 3)
        )
       )
    )
```

Wat in SIMD is omitted to show only main part i.e `v128 align=4` instructions
